# Activity #1:

Please evaluate your system on the following questions:

1.Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in simple terms to a complete beginner.

response : Sure! Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a way to write computer programs by organizing code around "objects." Here’s a simple way to understand it: - **Objects** are like things or items in real life. For example, a **car**, a **dog**, or a **phone**. - Each object has **attributes** (details about it). For a car, attributes could be color, model, and speed. - Objects can also have **actions** they can do, called **methods**. For example, a car can start, stop, or honk. In OOP, you create a **blueprint** called a **class** that defines what attributes and actions objects of that type will have. Then you make many objects (called **instances**) from that class. So, instead of writing lots of code that mixes everything together, you create objects that represent things, making your code easier to understand, reuse, and fix. **Example:** Imagine you want to create a program about pets. You make a "Pet" class with attributes like name and age, and actions like "make sound." Then you can create different pets like a dog or a cat as objects based on that class. That’s the basic idea of object-oriented programming!

Aspect Tested: This tested the model's ability to generate clear and accurate beginner-friendly content, the effect of the system prompt, and the app's ability to stream and display responses smoothly. It also verified the integration between the frontend and backend, as well as overall user experience.

2.Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points…

You: Large Language Models (LLMs) are a type of artificial intelligence designed to understand and generate human-like text based on patterns learned from immense datasets. These models, often built on the transformer architecture, leverage deep learning to analyze and predict the next word or sequence of words in a sentence. This capability allows them to perform various tasks, such as generating creative content, answering questions, translating languages, and assisting with software development.

AI: That's a great summary of Large Language Models (LLMs)! If you'd like, I can help explain any specific aspect in more detail, such as how the transformer architecture works, the training process of LLMs, or their applications and limitations. Just let me know!

Aspect Tested:I tested the app using the prompt, "Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points…" followed by a technical paragraph about Large Language Models (LLMs). This test assessed the model's ability to comprehend dense informational text and generate an accurate, brief summary. It also verified the model's natural language understanding, summarization capability, and its responsiveness to task-specific instructions. Additionally, the test ensured that the frontend handled input and streamed the summarized output correctly from the backend.

3.Write a short, imaginative story (100–150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.
 response:In a quiet scrapyard lived R-9, a small robot built from discarded parts. Every day, R-9 sifted through piles of metal, dreaming of connection but feeling alone. One rainy afternoon, a tiny bird with a broken wing landed on R-9’s shoulder. Startled but gentle, R-9 carefully extended a metal finger, and the bird chirped softly, trusting. Days passed, and R-9 fashioned a tiny splint from spare wires to help the bird fly again. In return, the bird brought R-9 shiny buttons, bright feathers, and stories of the world beyond the scrapyard. The unlikely friends shared silent conversations under the stars—R-9 in circuits, the bird in song. Together, they discovered that friendship doesn’t need words or form; it blooms where kindness and care meet, even between metal and feather. In that forgotten place, R-9 found a home—and a heart.

Aspect Tested: This assessed the model's creative writing abilities, narrative structure, and emotional tone. It tested how well the model could follow word count constraints and generate a coherent, engaging story. Additionally, the test verified that the app's frontend could handle longer, freeform user prompts and accurately stream the creative output from the backend.

3.If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?

response:To get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges: - Apples: sold in packs of 4. Number of packs needed = 12 ÷ 4 = 3 packs. - Oranges: sold in packs of 3. Number of packs needed = 9 ÷ 3 = 3 packs. **Answer:** Buy 3 packs of apples and 3 packs of oranges.

Aspect Tested:This tested the model's basic arithmetic and logical reasoning skills. It assessed whether the model could interpret a real-world math problem, apply division correctly, and provide an accurate, concise answer. It also verified the backend's ability to process structured, factual queries and the frontend's capability to handle and display numerical problem-solving responses effectively.

4.Rewrite the following paragraph in a professional, formal tone…

response:LLMs also inherit biases from their training data and can sometimes generate inaccurate or "hallucinated" information. Despite these challenges, LLMs are continuously evolving, with ongoing research focusing on improving their factual accuracy, efficiency, and ethical considerations.

AI: That's a great summary! Large Language Models (LLMs) indeed reflect the biases present in their training data, which can lead to perpetuating stereotypes or generating misleading content. Hallucinations—where the model produces plausible-sounding but false or nonsensical information—remain a key challenge. However, advancements in model architecture, training methods, and evaluation metrics are helping to enhance their reliability, reduce biases, and address ethical concerns. Continuous efforts in transparency, fairness, and user feedback integration are also critical to making LLMs safer and more trustworthy. If you'd like, I can provide more details on specific techniques used to mitigate these issues or examples of recent improvements.
Aspect Tested:This assessed the model's ability to perform text style transformation while preserving the original meaning. It tested the LLM's understanding of tone, vocabulary refinement, and sentence restructuring. Additionally, it verified that the app could handle editing tasks and stream polished, formal output through the frontend interface accurately.


DISCUSSION #1

What are some limitations of vibe checking as an evaluation tool?

Vibe checking as an evaluation tool has several limitations. It is highly subjective, relying on personal impressions rather than objective criteria. This can lead to inconsistent and biased judgments, where outputs that sound fluent or pleasant are favored over those that are factually accurate. Since it lacks standardized metrics, vibe checking is not easily reproducible across different evaluators, making it unreliable for consistent evaluation.
