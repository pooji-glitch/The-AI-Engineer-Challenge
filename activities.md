Activity #1:
Please evaluate your system on the following questions:

1.Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in simple terms to a complete beginner.
Aspect Tested:I tested the app using the prompt, “Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in simple terms to a complete beginner.” This tested the model's ability to generate clear and accurate beginner-friendly content, the effect of the system prompt, and the app’s ability to stream and display responses smoothly. It also verified the integration between the frontend and backend, as well as overall user experience.

2.Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points…
Aspect Tested:I tested the app using the prompt, “Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points…” followed by a technical paragraph about Large Language Models (LLMs). This test assessed the model’s ability to comprehend dense informational text and generate an accurate, brief summary. It also verified the model’s natural language understanding, summarization capability, and its responsiveness to task-specific instructions. Additionally, the test ensured that the frontend handled input and streamed the summarized output correctly from the backend.

3.Write a short, imaginative story (100–150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.
Aspect Tested:I tested the app with the prompt, “Write a short, imaginative story (100–150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.” This assessed the model’s creative writing abilities, narrative structure, and emotional tone. It tested how well the model could follow word count constraints and generate a coherent, engaging story. Additionally, the test verified that the app’s frontend could handle longer, freeform user prompts and accurately stream the creative output from the backend.

3.If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?
Aspect Tested:This tested the model’s basic arithmetic and logical reasoning skills. It assessed whether the model could interpret a real-world math problem, apply division correctly, and provide an accurate, concise answer. It also verified the backend's ability to process structured, factual queries and the frontend’s capability to handle and display numerical problem-solving responses effectively.

4.Rewrite the following paragraph in a professional, formal tone…
Aspect Tested:This assessed the model’s ability to perform text style transformation while preserving the original meaning. It tested the LLM’s understanding of tone, vocabulary refinement, and sentence restructuring. Additionally, it verified that the app could handle editing tasks and stream polished, formal output through the frontend interface accurately.


DISCUSSION #1

What are some limitations of vibe checking as an evaluation tool?

Vibe checking as an evaluation tool has several limitations. It is highly subjective, relying on personal impressions rather than objective criteria. This can lead to inconsistent and biased judgments, where outputs that sound fluent or pleasant are favored over those that are factually accurate. Since it lacks standardized metrics, vibe checking is not easily reproducible across different evaluators, making it unreliable for consistent evaluation.
